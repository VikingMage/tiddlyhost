Tiddlyhost
==========

The new new Tiddlyspot.

Rough plan (Jan 2021):
* Should be 100% containerized from the start
* Should use SSL from the start
* Will use Rails, for better or for worse
* Should have a serious deploy process (somehow)
* Should support subscription billing for users (somehow)
* Use S3 for saving Tiddlywiki files (probably)

Tiddlyhost will be somewhat based on an unfinished 2015-ish rewrite of
tiddlyspot-rails which used devise for account management.

I do want to opensource it, but will figure out how to to that later, probably
after it's functional.
